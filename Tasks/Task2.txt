### READ THIS
# In today's task we'll be talking about forks and pull requests.
# We started off by cloning this repo to our local devices. Forking a repo is just like cloning. The only difference is that
# the project is not being copied locally but to another online repo. Kind of like transferring files from one server to another.
# You first task is to:
1. Create a fork of this repo.
2. Send screenshots to the group if it's successful.

### READ THIS ALSO !!!
# You are familiar with git pull, right? Well there's an opposite of a 'git pull' which is a 
# 'git push' (obvious, wasn't it? :)) A git push basically involves uploading new changes to a remote. There a few rules to 
# remember though
# 1. You cannot push changes if there are changes to pulled.
# 2. To push you must have updated files from the remote repo otherwise nothing will happen.
# Before you push:
# 1. Make sure the files you want added are already tracked with git
#.2. Make sure you've commited your latest changes.
# For your task:
1. Do a git push following the above mentioned checklist.

### AND THIS !!!
# If you actually did do it right. You should get a 'permission denied' or 'operation not permitted' kind of message. Don't panic,
# it's supposed to happen. Try to imagine an online repo like a personal car. Not just anyone can drive it. Repos have permissions
# which cater of access control. Without such permissions, nothing would be stopping you from pushing changes to Facebook's repo or
# Google's repos. The are two ways to handle this. Either be given permission (Being made a collaborator to a repo) or pushing to 
# your own repo and making a pull request. A pull request can be likened to 'asking permission'. Basically you are telling the 
# owner of the repo that you need permission to make changes. This basically how people contribute to projects from different
# geographical areas.
# For your third task:
1. Go to your repo from task one. (NOT THE ONE WHERE YOU PULLED FROM)
2. Get the url for the repo
3. Add it to your git remotes in Netbeans (call it 'mine')
4. Try to push (Remember to select the right repo)
5. Send a screenshot of your online repo with the changes.


NOTE:
I'll only be accepting the first pull request to merge into my repo. The top three people with the most pull requests will
get awards! :)
